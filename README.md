> [!WARNING]
> This template is deprecated due to native ES6+TypeScript support released in k6 [v0.52.0](https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v0.52.0). Set the `--compatibility-mode=experimental_enhanced` option to use it. Check the [documentation for the details](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/javascript-typescript-compatibility-mode/#experimental-enhanced-mode).

This is a template repository showing how to use `Babel` and `Webpack` to bundle the different files into CommonJS modules, using its [`webpack.config.js`](./webpack.config.js) configuration.

In this project, you can write k6 tests using:
1. node module resolution.
2. external node modules and getting them automatically bundled.
3. unsupported ES+ features like the optional chaining ( `?.` ) operator.

## Installation

Click **Use this template** to create a repository from this template. 

Clone the generated repository on your local machine, move to the project root folder and install the dependencies defined in [`package.json`](./package.json)

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the test

Attempting to run the tests in [src](./src/) will fail because:
-  k6 does not know how to resolve node modules.
-  k6 does not recognize some ES+ features like the optional chaining ( `?.` ) operator. 

To address this, we'll use `Webpack` to bundle the dependencies and polyfill ES+ features.

```bash
npm run bundle
```

This command creates the final test files to the `./dist` folder.

Once that is done, we can run our script the same way we usually do, for instance:

```bash
k6 run dist/optional-chaining-test.js
# or 
k6 run dist/faker-test.js
```
